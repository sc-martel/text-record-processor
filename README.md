# CS499 Computer Science Capstone 2024
Developer: Scott Martel
Date: 07/19/2024

This application started as a C++ command-line application created in the CS-210 Programming Languages course during my first term at Southern New Hampshire University. The program is designed to analyze text records of items purchased, providing the user with insights such as the frequency of specific items, a list of all items with their frequency, and a histogram displaying the frequencies. This application reads an input text file and uses a map data structure to count and store the occurrences of each item.

In order to enhance this application for CS 499 Computer Science Capstone, I am converting this from a C++ command line application to a full stack modern web application using React JS, Material UI, and Google Firebase.
